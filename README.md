# GreatPlaces App

This is my next application. I won't lie that I ran into problems while creating it, but in the end I overcame those problems and learned a lot. So when it comes to the functionality of the application, the user is presented with a list of places he has visited. After clicking anywhere from the list, the user will see:
- a photo taken for a given place
- place address
- a button that will show this place on the map

The user can also add a new place during which:
- must provide the title of the place
- has to take a photo
- must choose ANY place on the map (or choose HIS CURRENT LOCATION)

Once a place is added, it is added to the local SQL application database. And that's it. Kind of a simple application but the main focus here was on Goole Maps, the camera and local data storage. And this is what the application looks like:

Cons of the application:
- it is not possible to remove visited places from the list
- the application does not look nice, it looks very simple

What have i learned:
- integrating the application with Google Cloud Platform
- creating a local SQL database for data storage
- using the camera in the application and saving photos
- using Google Maps in the application

And much much more...

In the near future I will post one more cool app, probably the most difficult for me so far from all that I have done.
